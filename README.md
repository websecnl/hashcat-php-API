# hashcat-php-API
Under Development

First use the ./setup.sh in order to prepare all files automatically, once its done your API should be ready.
(The setup.sh is only tested on ubuntu, requires modification in order to work with redhat based linux machines)

Usage: yourwebsite.x/hashcat.php?hash=HASH&wordlist=WORDLISTFILENAME&rule=RULEFILENAME
